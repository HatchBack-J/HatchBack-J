### Who?
---
Name - Carter Hatcher

If you've had a chance to look at my LinkedIn, great! If not, no worriesâ€”I'll keep this brief.

For most of my adult life, I have acted in mechanical technician roles in a variety in industries. Granted, there isn't much overlap in security as far as technical skills but Iâ€™m confident that the soft skills Iâ€™ve developed along the way will prove just as valuable. Soft skills, sush as effectively communicating highly technical concepts to "need to know" parties that may not have an understanding or troubleshooting complex problems in unconventional ways.

### Why?
---
My goal is to transition into the security field while leveraging the knowledge that I have picked up along the way. The purpose of this portfolio is to not only showcase what I have accomplished so far but to hopefully leave a positive impression on you.
