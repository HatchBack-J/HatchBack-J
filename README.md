### Who?
---
Name - Carter Hatcher

If you've had a chance to look at my LinkedIn, great! If not, no worries—I'll keep this brief.

For most of my adult life, I have acted in mechanical technician roles in a variety in industries. Granted, there isn't much overlap in security as far as technical skills but I’m confident that the soft skills I’ve developed along the way will prove just as valuable. Soft skills, sush as effectively communicating highly technical concepts to "need to know" parties that may not have an understanding or troubleshooting complex problems in unconventional ways.

### Why?
---
My goal is to transition into the cybersecurity field, leveraging the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired thus far. This portfolio is designed not only to showcase what I’ve accomplished but also to ideally leave a positive and lasting impression on you.

As for why I’ve chosen such a dramatic career change, it’s clear that the modern world is increasingly reliant on technology and connectivity. As companies grow and expand, their reliance on secure, modern infrastructure becomes a necessity. Skilled security professionals are critical in this and I intend to be a part of that wave of professionals.
